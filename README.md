## Message

Each commit message uploaded to the repository **must**...

- be succinct, but **descriptive**,
- be written in English,
- start with a verb written in the [simple past] tense,
- include a summary limited by 72 characters,
- start with a capital letter, but finish without a period.

Besides, if the summary isn't enough to explain the commit,
you should then include a description.  
And adding one is a piece of :cake:.

```sh
$ git commit -m "This is a summary" -m "And this is a description."
```

These are some examples of commit messages that meet the above rules.

`Added a command-line option to parse the score rules`  
`Adapted the code to harvest data from multiple sites`  
`Replaced a couple of magic numbers`
